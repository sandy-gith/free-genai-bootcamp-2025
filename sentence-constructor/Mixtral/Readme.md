Student Input: 가지고 잠그다 문?

Output:
Interpretation and Feedback:
----------------------------

Your attempt, "가지고 잠그다 문", can be interpreted as "to lock a door while holding something" in English. However, it's not the correct way to express the sentence in Korean.

The correct Korean phrase would be "문을 잠그고 있니?" or "문을 잠갔는지 확인해 주세요?" These translations are closer to the intended meaning, which is "Have you locked the door?" or "Could you check if the door is locked?"

Considerations:
---------------

* You used the correct verb for locking a door (잠그다), but the structure of your attempt needs improvement.
* To make a question, you should use a question particle like "니" or form a question sentence using the correct tense.
* The sentence you provided is closer to "I'm locking the door while holding something" in meaning.

Next Steps:
-----------

* Practice structure questions in Korean using question particles.
* Review the sentence structure provided to create a question.
* You can also ask for clues about:
  + Formulating questions in Korean.
  + Using correct verb conjugations in questions.
  + Adding question particles to sentences.
