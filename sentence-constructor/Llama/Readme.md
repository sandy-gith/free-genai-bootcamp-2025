## Output for user attempt 

Student Input: 가지고 잠그다 문?

Output:
Here's how your attempt can be interpreted:

"가지고 잠그다 문" can be translated to "Lock the door with something" (not entirely incorrect, but not the intended meaning).

A more natural way to express "Have you locked the door?" in Korean would be "문 잠그셨어요?" (Have you locked the door? - polite) or "문 잠갔다?" (Did you lock the door? - informal).

Considerations

* You used the correct verb "잠그다" (to lock), but the sentence structure and particle usage need improvement.
* The word "가지고" (with/to have) is not necessary in this context.
* You didn't use the correct question particle to form a question.
* The verb conjugation is also incorrect.

For the second part of the sentence, "Yesterday a theft was reported in the neighbourhood", you didn't attempt to translate it. Here's a breakdown of how you could approach it:

* Use the vocabulary from the table:Yesterday (昨日) - yeoreo, theft (盜竊) - doi, report (報告) - bogo, neighborhood (近所) - geunseo.
* Think about the sentence structure: [Time] [Event] [Location] [Event].

## Inference / Observations
- llama model sometimes provide complex korean characters which a beginner might not even aware of
- these characters doesn't even look like korean, seems like a chinese derivatives
- not all the time but sometimes this happens, which is considered as inconsistent.
- but llama captures the output format more appropriately than other  models
