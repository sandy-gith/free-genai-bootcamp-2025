### Sentence Structure

1. [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?  
2. [Time] [Subject] [Verb] [Location].  

### Considerations

- The sentence contains a question and a statement connected by a comma.
- The first part is a question asking about an action in the present.
- The second part provides additional information about an event that happened in the past.
- The student needs to figure out the correct particles for subject, object, and location.
- The student needs to conjugate verbs appropriately for tense and sentence type.

### Possible Next Steps

- Attempt to translate the sentence using the vocabulary and structure provided.
- Ask for clues about:
  - Using particles for subject, object, and location.
  - Verb conjugation for present and past tense.
  - Structuring compound sentences in Korean.
  - Forming questions in Korean.

## Output for user attempt 

Student Input: 가지고 잠그다 문?

Output:
Here's how your attempt can be interpreted:

"가지고 잠그다 문?" can be translated to "Do you lock the door with something?" which is not the intended meaning. A more natural way to ask "Have you locked the door?" in Korean would be "당신이 문을 잠그었니?" (Did you lock the door?) or "문이 잠겨 있니?" (Is the door locked?).

Considerations

* The word order in your sentence is a bit off. In Korean, the typical sentence structure is Subject-Object-Verb.
* You didn't use the correct particle (을/를) for the object "문" (door).
* The verb "잠그다" (to lock) needs to be conjugated appropriately to form a question.
* The second part of the sentence about the theft report is missing in your attempt.

Possible Next Steps

* Try to rephrase the first part using the correct word order and particles.
* Attempt to include the second part of the sentence about the theft report.
* Ask for clues about:
  - Correct word order in Korean sentences.
  - Using particles for objects and locations.
  - Verb conjugation for questions and past tense.
  - Connecting clauses in Korean sentences.
