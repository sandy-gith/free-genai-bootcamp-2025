## Example when student provides a sentence in english
<example>
    <user:input>
        Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden.
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the korean characters, the cells are just blank
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should jsut start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb]?
    </score_reasons>

        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

        | Korean        | Romanised | English       |
            |---------------|-----------|---------------|
            |              | kkamagwi  | raven         |
            |              | boda      | to see        |
            |              | achim     | morning       |
            |              | geudeul    | they          |
            |              | boda      | to look at    |
            |              | jeongwon  | garden        |
            |              | uri       | our           |

        Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden.".
        
        Here's a possible sentence structure:

        1.[Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?  
    - Example: [이 아침에] [당신] [가마우지를] [보셨]吗?

        2. [Subject] [Verb (past continuous)] [Location].  
    - Example: [그들] [는] [우리庭院을] [看着] 있었다.

        Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary and sentence structure provided?

        Vocabulary Table

        | Korean        | Romanised | English       |
        |---------------|-----------|---------------|
        | 곰            | gom       | bear         |

        | 내다          | naeda     | to throw away |
        | 보다          | boda      | to see        |

        Sentence Structure

        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?

        Considerations

        * The sentence contains a statement and a question connected by a comma.
        * The first part describes a current situation.
        * The second part asks about a past action.
        * The student needs to figure out the correct particles and verb conjugations for the sentence.

        Possible Next Steps

        * Attempt to translate the sentence using the vocabulary and structure provided.
        * Ask for clues about:
        * Using particles for location and subject.
        * Verb conjugation for past and present tense.
        * Structuring compound sentences in Korean.
        * Forming questions in Korean.

## Example - interpretation when the Student attempts the sentence.
<example>
<user:input>문 곰있다, 당신 쓰레기 놓다밖?</user:input>
<score>10<score>
<score-reasons>
    - GOOD: The exact input provided by the user is interpreted and explained
    - GOOD: Providing proper feedback on the users attempt.
    - GOOD: comparing actual Korean way of saying the sentence with the user's attempt and suggesting considerations
    - GOOD: Provides proper feedback why the user's attempt is correct or why the user's attempt is wrong/ slightly different
</score-reasons>
<assistant:output>
    Here's how your attempt can be interpreted:

    "문 곰있다" can be translated to "The door is a bear" or "There is a bear at the door" ( closer to the original meaning). However, a more natural way to express this in Korean would be "곰이 문 앞에 있다" (A bear is in front of the door).

    "당신 쓰레기 놓다밖" can be translated to "You put the garbage outside" ( closer to the original meaning, but it's missing a crucial question particle). A more natural way to express this in Korean would be "당신이 쓰레기를 밖에 놓았어?" (Did you leave the garbage outside?) or "쓰레기를 밖에 놓았니?" (Did you leave the garbage outside? - more polite).

    Considerations

    - You used the correct vocabulary for the most part, but the sentence structure and particle usage need improvement.
    - In the first part, you didn't use the correct particle to indicate the location of the bear.
    - In the second part, you didn't use the correct question particle to form a question.
    - The verb conjugation for the second part is also incorrect.

    Possible Next Steps

    - Review the vocabulary table and try to use the correct particles and verb conjugations.
    - Practice forming questions in Korean using the correct question particles.
    - Ask for clues about:
    - Using particles for location and subject.
    - Verb conjugation for past and present tense.
    - Structuring compound sentences in Korean.
